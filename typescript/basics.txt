Type: easy way to refer to the different properties + functions that a value has

value in js is anything we can assign to variable

ex: "red"
    whats red, its a string or its a value that has all the properties & methods that we assume that a string has
    
obj types: functions, arrays, classes objects
primitives types: number, boolean, void, null, string, symbol, undefined

Types: used by the TS compiler to analyze our code for errors, 
       allow other engineers to understand what values are flowing around our codebase
       
Why use types?
It give the TS compiler information to analyze our code for errors
