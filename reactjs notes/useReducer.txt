whats a side effect ?

Main job of react is to evaluate a component and render the UI. Any other task
would be called side effect, like 
   - a component requesting data from server,
   - storing data into the broswer, 
   - sending http request,
   - set and manage timers

To handle side effect we will use useEffect() hook,
   - called with 2 para,
      ex: useEffect(() => {...}, [ dependencies ]);
                    -----------    ------------
                    1st parameter   2nd parameter 
      
      1st para: a function that should be executed after every component
                evaluation if the specified dependencies changed.

      2nd para: dependencies of this effect - the function only runs if the dependencies changed
