// useRef
it allows access to other DOMS & let us work with them,
if we only need to read values we should use useRef
if we only need to read values from the input box we should use useRef and avoid using onChange, because it will fire on every keystroke,

also, if we just wanna reset the value, we can use ref, cuz technically its not manipulating DOM.

neither useRef or using state is better than each other,
use state when we actually need to change something,
if we just wanna read value, ref is pro approach(after its all about writing concise code), 

CAUTION: using refs is like playing dart when you're drunk, where dart board is your BALLS, and your drunk friends are throwing the dart. 0_0
