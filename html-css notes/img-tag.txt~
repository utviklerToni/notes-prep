Use IMG if you intend to have people print your page and you want the image to be included by default. —JayTee
Use IMG (with alt text) when the image has an important semantic meaning, such as a warning icon. This ensures that the meaning of the image can be communicated in all user-agents, including screen readers.
Pragmatic uses of IMG
Use IMG plus alt attribute if the image is part of the content such as a logo or diagram or person (real person, not stock photo people). —sanchothefat
Use IMG if you rely on browser scaling to render an image in proportion to text size.
Use IMG for multiple overlay images in IE6.
Use IMG with a z-index in order to stretch a background image to fill its entire window.
Note, this is no longer true with CSS3 background-size; see #6 below.
Using img instead of background-image can dramatically improve performance of animations over a background.
When to use CSS background-image

Use background-image if you intend to have people print your page and you do not want the image to be included by default. —JayTee
