Array helpers methods are very helpful to deal with data collection projects when we build any web apps.
7 important array helper methods
forEach, map, filter, find, every, some, reduce

NOTE: These helps to avoid using for loops

NOTE: while using map make sure to "return" the function or else we get an array of null

CAUTION: where to use forEach() 

  difference between for of and forEach loop
  We cannot break out of a forEach loop, continue and break statements do work 
  break in a forEach loop, it loops through the entire array
