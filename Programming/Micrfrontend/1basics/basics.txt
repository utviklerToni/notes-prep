~ A monolithic app can be divided into smaller groups of app, isolating them for better use.
~ Helps avoid chaining of services aka dependency, if one goes down, not all will go down.

~ Gives the benefits of adding distinct feature to each of those isolated smaller group of apps.

~ Multiple team can work in isolation, and on top of that its easy to understand and make changes without creating a mess.(won't break other part of the application.) :)


****************************************************
~ Ways to implement, 3 major categories

1. Build time integration (compile time integration)
   example: 
   ~ Before container gets loaded in the browser, it gets access to ProductsList source code


2. Run time integration (client side integration)
   example: 
   ~ After container gets loaded in the browser, it gets access to ProductsList source Code

3. Server integration
   ~ While sending down JS to load up container, a server decides on whether or not to include ProductsList source.


NOTE: the whole point of micro-frontend is to have murican military precision isolation, just like microservices, hence the name Micro Frontend
