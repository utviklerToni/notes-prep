def: a singly linked lists contains a set of nodes, each node has two elements,
  1. value
  2. pointer (points to the next node)
  
  ~ first node is called head and the last node is called tail

cons & pros:
  ~ insertion in middle is lot better
  ~ deleting is also easy than array
  ~ sorting is also better
  ~ elements are not indexed here so its O(n)
  ~ traversing or iterating is slower than array

**********************
 
highlights:
  prepend O(1)
  append O(1)

  lookup O(n)
  insert O(n)
  delete O(n)

Pointer: a reference to another location in the memory
