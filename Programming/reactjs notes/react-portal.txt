section 9 notes: 
react portal:
    react-dom is used to bring all the react logic and its feature into the browser

    the idea of ReactDOM.createPortal() is to move the render HTML content moved somewhere else in the structure

    it can be used anywhere we can use jsx/component 
    BUT ONLY in the actual dom is being rendered
    
// why we use ref
