useReducer: 
   - can be used as a replacemnt of useState, 
   - its a powerful state management tool


Ex: 
 const emailChangeHandler = (event) => {
      setEnteredEmail(event.target.value);

      setFormIsValid(
         event.target.value.includes('@') && enteredPassword.trim().length > 6
      );
   };

   in the above code there is a chance that setFormIsValid() might run before the enteredPassword is processed and this can happen due to how react schedules state update/change, for such case we can use useReducer()
