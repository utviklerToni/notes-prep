Isloating the execution of JS inside the browser, rather doing it on a separate server, since browser has some restriction/rules.

Its an environment/container in which a program written in JS can be executed outside of browser. V8 engine executes these codes.

Node.js uses a single threaded model in order to support async processing, so it can be more scalable.

Pros:
single-threaded, bases on event driven, non-blocking I/O model.
For fast and scalable data-intensive apps.

ex: chat app, video streaming, API with database behind it(NoSQL)

Cons:
Heavy server-side processing (CPU intensive)
