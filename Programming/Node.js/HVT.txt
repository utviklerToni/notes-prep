1. Purpose of module.exports ? 
   - Encapsulate the related codes into a single unit of code which can be interpreted by moving all the functions into a single file. (isolating codes)

2. Reactor Pattern ? 
   - concept of async/sync operations,
   - handler for I/O operations,
   - trigger, notify and then queue the operations, hence generating Event queue

3. Use case ? (all for backend)
   - authentication
   - error handling
   - intensive data handing apps
   - live chat apps, including vid streaming

4. Middleware in Node.js

5. URL module ?
   - Splits up web address into a readable format

6. Control flow function?
   - the way code is executed between the async function calls.
   - exe must be controlled, collect data...etc
   - concurrency must be limited, 
   - invoke the next program


7. spawn() vs fork()
   - spawn() : launch a new process with provided set of commands
   - fork() : special instance of spawn, exe a new instance of v8
