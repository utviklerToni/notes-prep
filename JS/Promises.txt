PROMISE : an object that is used as a placeholder for the future result of an asynchronous operation.
ex : a response from a server (ajax calls)

advantage of promise:
    - no longer need to rely on events and callbacks passed into async func to handle async results.
    - we can use it to chain promises for async ops and avoid "callback hell"
